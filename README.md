# MedScanner
While taking medicines, some people often make the mistake of choosing the wrong medicine for a certain health issue. Which often leads them to severe health hazards and sufferings of the patients. 

Let's imagine that, these patients have an assistant who checks whether they are taking the right medicine every time. If not, the assistant notifies the patient immediately and helps the patient to choose the right one. Not only that, but this assistant also tells necessary information regarding the medicine as well as the disease, depending on the age, gender and health condition of the patient. Imagine how helpful the assistant would be!
 
Our app- MedScanner does all the above, and more! By simply holding the camera in front of the medicine packet, the patient can immediately know whether they are taking the right medicine or not. Moreover, they get useful information regarding medicine in real-time. Thanks to the techniques of machine learning, now we can achieve quite accurate "image to text" conversion using the modern image processing algorithms! The algorithm takes the image as input and instantly detects the medicine name, which is used for the further process.

Our app also keeps a record of the patient's health issues which helps it better detect whether the medicine is the right one for the patient. Moreover, in case of wrong medicines, it can suggest alternatives.
